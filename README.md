# Sidewalk #

An object plugin that generates parametric euro-style sidewalks.

The original method of constructing it was described by Fredi Voss (www.fredivoss.de).

Aspiring plugin developers can learn the following from it:
* Generator object plugins derived from `class ObjectData`
* Creating complex object hierarchies
* Efficient and carefree memory allocation and freeing with `AutoAlloc<>` and `AutoFree<>`
